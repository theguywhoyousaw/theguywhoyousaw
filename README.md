## Hi there 👋

I’m a reverse engineer focused on low-level systems and software internals.

While most of my work remains private, I occasionally share proof-of-concepts (PoCs) designed to inspire creative work.
These contributions are typically starting points for a more complete usage case.

Credit me if you use my work.
